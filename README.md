Please choose the appropriate operating system and install the softwares.
After installing the softwares, Please run (see also the screenshot):

install.packages("PredPsych",dependencies = TRUE)

This step should ask you for the CRAN repository (choose the one closest to you)

After selection, the command should download required packages (This might take a bit!)

After installation, please run (source) the file 'first_run_me.R' by either:

1.	opening in Rstudio and clicking source (see screenshot in the Screenshots folder).
2.	Running the command:
source("path/to/file/run_me_first.R")
e.g. for user koul:
source("C:/Users/koul/Documents/run_me_first.R")

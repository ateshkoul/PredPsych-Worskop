After installing the softwares, Please run (see also the screenshot):

This step should ask you for the CRAN repository (choose the one closest to you)

After selection, the command should download required packages (This might take a bit!)

After installation, please download the R file 'first_run_me.R' by clicking on the file link in github and right clicking on 'save link as' on raw (see screenshot). After this, run (source) the file  by either:

1.	opening in Rstudio and clicking source (see screenshot in the Screenshots folder).
2.	Running the command:
source("path/to/file/run_me_first.R")
e.g. for user koul:

Please choose the appropriate operating system and install the softwares.
After installing the softwares, Please run (see also the screenshot):

This step should ask you for the CRAN repository (choose the one closest to you)

After selection, the command should download required packages (This might take a bit!)

After (hopefully successful) installation, please run(source) the file 'first_run_me.R' by opening in Rstudio and clicking source (see screenshot).

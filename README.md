Materials for the MeeTo 2018: Workshop 'PredPsych'

Please choose the appropriate operating system and install the softwares.
After installing the softwares, Please run (see also the screenshot):

install.packages("PredPsych",dependencies = TRUE)

This step should ask you for the CRAN repository (choose the one closest to you)

After selection, the command should download required packages (This might take a bit!)

After (hopefully successful) installation, please run(source) the file 'first_run_me.R' by opening in Rstudio and clicking source (see screenshot).

In case of errors/doubts, please feel free to ask a question on the PredPsych google group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/predpsych

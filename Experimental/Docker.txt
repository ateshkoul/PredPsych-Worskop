# This file contains the instructions for building docker image of PredPsych
# Brief discription from Wikipedia:
# Docker is a set of coupled software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service products 
# that use operating-system-level virtualization to develop and deliver software in packages called containers. 

# The dockers allow a transfer of so called images across platforms. 
# This is similar to having a fully built programs that are sure to work.

# Advantages of using docker:
# 1. Since docker runs on your hardware directly, it doesn't change any programs or software of your operating system.
#     This means that if you are already running R/Rstudio on your computer, the docker image doesn't influence any of those programs
# 2. Since the image is already built, you already have a running version of R,Rstudio, predpsych and other packages installed.

# To run PredPsych docker image, ensure that you have sufficient space (approx around 2 GB).
# Follow the steps in sequence:

1. Download and install docker (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop for mac and windows, 
                                https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce for Ubuntu) 
                                
2. In command line, use:
   > docker pull ateshkoul/predpsych
This should install the predpsych latest image

3. Run the docker in your browser:
   > docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=predpsych ateshkoul/predpsych

 4. Open your browser and use the address:
    > localhost:8787/
 Use the username as rstudio and the password as the password (predpsych) in the previous command.
 
 That's it! you are ready to use PredPsych
 
 # Common Issues:
 1. Ensure that you use sudo in case of Ubuntu.
 2. Ensure that no other program is using localhost (jupyter notebook/dask etc.)
